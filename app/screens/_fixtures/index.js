Our authority in life to govern this earth is the humanmind! Every human being has a mind. If the only thing capable of making or destroying you, is your mind. Naturally, the unsaved man is wicked enough to destroy himself without no remorse. The human mind is our pride and also our doom. There is no trouble today that came from heaven. But every world’s problem we are facing today is mind-made by man.',
            'I have read books, attended seminars, and conferences across the world on this topic, the human Mind. I have observed people from different race, nationalities, tribes, and religious backgroundsto know the secret behind their social and moral differences. I used to think God Himself is the one who has differentiated us by making rich people and making poor people separately. Many times in the past, I would ask God saying; why did you make many poor people and just few rich ones? This question was still in me until one day I finally got the answer. The answer is, God did not make rich people nor did He make poor People. God only made people. It is upto the people to be rich or to be poor!',
            'Your mind is the custodian of all the wealth you can humanly imagine. Your mind doesn’t only hold wealth, but it holds and controls all areas of your very being as well. What makes you wealthy, happy or poor and bitter is your mind. A happy brain cannot make up for a confused and lost mind. Your mind is the very most important side of your nature as a human. Most people are not aware of this truth; that they are where they are today because of their minds. Never pay much attention to your brain than your mind because your mind is to your brain what a father is to his five-year-old son.',
            'The secret to all the differences in the world today (as far as life is concern) is the mind. Your profession, degrees, country, race, ethnicity or religion have nothing, absolutely nothing to do with your life. Your mind is where your power to become lies. In other words, the outcome of your life depends on your mental disposition. Your mind is responsible for where you are today, and you are responsible for the management of your mind. Your mind is not and will never be the responsibility of the creator. It is yours and always will be your responsibility.',

It is the second side of human nature and the most important one too. What is it? The human mind!!Your ability to do and your power to undo anything in this life isin your mind. And with your mind, youcreate through meditation and imagination your world. If there is anything you must be careful of the most, is your mind. The wronged use of your mind would cost you your life and your purpose.',

It has the power to produce in you a good or bad attitude. The world could be sweet or sour, depending onyour mental state. The transformation of every human being takes place inthe human mind.Nothing is more valuable to the enemy than your mind. Your life is not the enemy’s primary target;his primary target is your mind. Living in this world with no control of your mind is worse than death. The enemy is doing everything possible to get control of your mind. Don’t let him!',
            'A well-used mind has no limit. Nothing is impossible forone who correctly uses the mind. You can accomplish far more than what people think you could when you use your mind right. Put it to use by involving in the act of meditation and imagination.A rich man is not one with plentymoney but one with a sound mind. A sound-minded man is wise and loving to all. Peace of mind is with a sound-minded man; nothing worries or stresses him. He is confidence and patient, and to him, there aremore possibilities than impossibilities.',
            'Your mind is precious to the Creator, and He wants to protect it for you with His word. The Maker’s peace and righteousness are all available to your mind for possession. Your mind is the only side of your human nature where your Manufacture’s manual for your life is made known.It is not only the body that needs enrichment. The soul too needs it. Don’t just grow physically but also grow spiritually (soul). Eating the right food is very important, and the mind needs the right food to grow if not it will malnourish. Divine words, Instruction, diligence, and mentorship are the best food for the human mind. Therefore get them and grow from all sides.',
            'Managing your mind is the wisest thing to do. Your mind is not a night club where every jack and rose, Tom and jerry junks should come and do as they please.  Manage your mind by being selective of the things you see and hear, since your eye and ear are the two gates ways into your mind. Don’t live ignorantly of your mind. Your mind cannot manage itself; you got to do the managing for yourself and your good.',
